# Getting Started with Vite

This project was created with build tool [Vite](https://v2.vitejs.dev/).
Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn preview`

Locally preview the production build. Do not use this as a production server as it's not designed for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Vite documentation: Getting Started](https://v2.vitejs.dev/guide/).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### `yarn test`

### `yarn coverage`

Run vitest based test with coverage (need spinning up the app to pass the tests)
